# Python Installer

Python installer is a bash script to install python-1.6.1. When I was trying to install just regular python on my server,
I kept getting an error message telling me python has been deprecated and to install python2 or 3. So this
script will install python for you. I made this to help others that run into the error/problem. It will automate the process for you and thats what we all like right. xD

Thanks and Enjoy

## Usage
```python
git clone https://github.com/x10mrrobot01x/python-installer.git
cd python-installer
chmod +x python-installer.sh
./python-installer
```
